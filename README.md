### Project Diary

- __13/01/2022__
  - Started setting up the folder structure.
- __14/01/2022__
  - Pseucoding the logic. I've been recently introduced to useReducer via School of Code and it hasn't quite clicked yet. From what I understand, as it helps to manage complex states, a calculator would be a perfect example, so I will implement it in my code. 
- __21/01/2022__
  - All features have been implemented, styling has also been modified. Project submitted to freeCodeCamp and passed all the tests. 
  - The logic for this was trickier than I initially thought. Having to account for all the possibile input (right and wrong) made my code a bit dirty and more chaotic than I wanted it to be. I ended up not using useReducer and resorting to if/else statements. I'm happy that it works, but also feel I can come back to this and refactor it once I become more confident with useReducer.
