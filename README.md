### Project Diary

- __13/01/2022__
  - Started setting up the folder structure.
- __14/01/2022__
  - Pseucoding the logic. I've been recently introduced to useReducer via School of Code and it hasn't quite clicked yet. From what I understand, as it helps to manage complex states, a calculator would be a perfect example, so I will implement it in my code.
